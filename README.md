# Codedex Mini Hackathon (Track 2: Now, it's Personal)

## Challenge

Capture the fun, homebrew vibe of the early internet, when everyone had their own little corner of the web. This is YOUR design, let your retro flag fly!

## Arcade.io

Play free online games. Immerse yourself in this retro themed arcade website while you sit back, relax, and enjoy playing a video game! This project theme is inspired by the 90s dot-com era.

As I was growing up, I had the opportunity to dive into the world wide web. This experience was truly unique. From custom myspace pages, to playing arcade games from websites such as Miniclip or Funorb, this era of the internet was incredibly entertaining. There was no greater feeling for myself than to log in to an MMO like Club Penguin, Runescape, or Maplestory.

This project pays homage to these arcade websites where millions of users visited to play free online games. The design of this website is inspired by traditional arcades where customers can enjoy playing arcade games on a machine. The most notable part of this design is the dim atmosphere with neon lights glowing. A nostalgic design choice for the Codedex mini winter hackathon theme, Hack like its 1999.

### Features

- **90s retro arcade**: Upon visiting this page, users will be greeted with a vibrant, glowing header.
- **Featured game**: The featured game section displays one game, which is Club Penguin. Unfortunately, this is only shown for display due to the fact that Club Penguin is no longer available. However, this should be a nostalgic surprise to those who remember playing this legendary video game!
- **My games**: Scrolling down the page, users will find that the next section contains games built by me, Alex Marmolejo. I took the opportunity to create this section to show some of the games I have built throughout my coding journey! Feel free to have a look!
- **Additional games**: Scrolling further down the page, users will find another list of games. These are games I have found throughout the internet. Some of these games are popular in modern times, and some are old favorites, such as Pacman. These are real games with appropriate links to these games.
- **Gifs**: Across this website are retro arcade gifs along with retro anime gifs, which are used to enhance the 90s vibe.
